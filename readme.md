Quick draft I made in 2013 with SDL. 

In this app, SDL was mainly used to learn about animations and layers. It's not the best code friendly, but if you are starting C/C++ and SDL, it's a good way to learn about animations, and how ***SDL_Surfaces*** works. I think you've already guessed it, but this is discontinued. I don't plan on updating it anymore.
